## AutoHotKey shortcuts for workflow

Part of a group inbox and have to reply from it? Have the problem of either having to copy and paste your email signature or change the signature each time was annoying.

1. Step 1 copy your signature.
2. Run script gmailSigScript.ahk
    * This should create a rtf file that contains your signature 
3. Script workFlow.ahk will use this file when window + a is pressed.
4. Pastes your signature without having to copy/paste it.


Other shortcut contains
* I like to have capslock as a fn key. Shuts off capslock to be able to use it with other keys.
* Caps lock and jkli as arrow keys.
* Windows q opens salesforce report used very often.
* Windows w with use clipboard of 15 digit salesforce id and convert to 18 digits though [admin booster](www.adminbooster.com/tool/15to18) and copy back to clipboard
* For some reason the word eligibility gives me trouble. So a replacement for a word I mispell.
